	<h1>All About Me</h1>	
	<p> I'm Zinaira, but most of the time I go by Z. I'm 17 years old and enjoy making art. I'm a September Virgo and my favorite season is fall because the weather is just perfect and I just love it! I love playing volleyball and i'm currently on the team in my school. </p>

	<h2> Future Goals</h2>
	<p> I plan to go to college in the fall 2024 semester, and tryout for the volleyball team in the school. I would like to be a high school teacher and plan on taking all steps to accomplish my goal.</p>
