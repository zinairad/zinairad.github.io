	<p> In this project we were instruced to create anything we pleased, and I made this painting. I named it "Freedom" to represent peace and freedom, because during that time I felt like I really needed it. I painted the beach to show the peace thatâ€™s needed in my life- and maybe many others lives right now.</p>

<img src="../jet.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/>
	<p> In this project we had to create oragamis and I chose to make a jet. First I designed my paper and colored it, then I began to fold the paper to look like a jet. It is not like a paper plane, so it does not fly- but it does look cool !</p>
